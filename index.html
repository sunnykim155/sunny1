<img src="js.jpg" width="100%'">
<p>New York (CNN Business) With all the volatility in the market lately,
it may seem rash to make much of one week's trading.</p> But value stocks
companies in sectors like energy, financial services and retail -- have finally
started to outperform sexier technology companies and other growth stocks.
Could this be a start of a new trend? A time for value to shine at last?
The S&P 500 Value index (SPYV) gained nearly 5% in the past week, while the S&P
500 Growth Index (SPYG) is up about 2.5%. The S&P Technology Sector (XLK)
exchange traded fund, which is home to many of the top FAANG stocks,
has increased 2%.<p styly="margin-top:40px;">Big tech stocks have lagged a bit recently. That's partly
because of concerns about how much they've run up from the market's March lows
but there are also renewed worries about a crackdown on Twitter (TWTR)
and other social media firms by President Trump.
